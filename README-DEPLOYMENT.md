## Common Questions

### Q: Can I deploy the research agent now?

**A**: Technically yes (code is ready), but it won't be functional until gateway shows 10+ tools. Better to fix gateway first.

### Q: How long will deployment take?

**A**:
- If gateway working: 10 minutes
- If gateway needs fix: 2-3 hours (diagnosis + fix + deploy)

### Q: What if deployment fails?

**A**: Use rollback procedure in **MCP-CONNECTION-PLAN.md** Part 6 or **QUICK-DEPLOY.md** Rollback section. One-liner to revert.

### Q: How do I know if it's working?

**A**: Run `./validate-mcp-connection.sh` - should show all green checkmarks. Or check health endpoint shows `toolCount: 10`.

### Q: What if I only need Context7?

**A**: See **MCP-GATEWAY-STATUS.md** "Option C" for direct Context7 connection bypass (2 tools, 25 min setup).

### Q: Where are the logs?

**A**:
- Research Agent: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/e13e1c19-b542-422d-8c21-40c45b3bb982/logs
- MCP Gateway: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/e039c351-056f-45ab-ae40-abe02173c25a/logs
